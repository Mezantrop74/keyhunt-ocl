# keyhunt-ocl
_Hunt for Bitcoin private keys._

This is a modified version of [oclexplorer](https://github.com/svtrostov/oclexplorer.git) by svtrostov.

To convert Bitcoin legacy addresses to RIPEMD160 hasehs use this [b58dec](https://github.com/kanhavishva/b58dec).

It is important to binary sort the RIPEMD160 file before giving it to the program, otherwise binary search function would not work properly. To do this work use this [RMD160-Sort](https://github.com/kanhavishva/RMD160-Sort).


## Changes

- Renamed from oclexplorer to KeyHunt (inspired from [keyhunt](https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt) by albertobsd).
- Modified opencl kernel to match for both compressed and un-compressed keys addresses.
- Added bloom filter for fast matchings.
- Transfer only bloom data to GPU device and keep hash160 data in system memory, this way we can load a very large hash file.
- For args parsing it uses [argparse](https://github.com/jamolnng/argparse) by jamolnng)
- It supports GPU only.

## ToDo

- Add feature to search in given key-space range.
